**Calculation:**
```
Active users (no ad blocker): 140 users
Sessions per day: 1.5
Banner impressions per session: 3
Daily impressions: 140 × 1.5 × 3 = 630 impressions

eCPM (effective cost per 1000 impressions): $3.00

### 2. REWARDED VIDEO ADS

**Calculation:**
```
Users who watch ads: 140 × 35% = 49 users
Videos per session: 1.5
Daily video views: 49 × 1.5 = 73.5 views

eCPM: $15.00 (highest paying format!)

```

**Interstitial Revenue: ~$2.52/day**

---

## 💰 TOTAL DAILY REVENUE: ~$5.51/day

### Monthly Revenue (30 days):
**$5.51 × 30 = ~$165/month**
